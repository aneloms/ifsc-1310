                Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations.
                Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in history to deliver cargo
                to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by
                governments. It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts
                of cargo to Earth. Currently, Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to
                carry humans. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable
                Dragon to fly crew. Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.

                    <ul class="config-list">
                        <li><strong>DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES</strong> - Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deliver
                            cargo to the International Space Station and currently the only cargo spacecraft flying capable
                            of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth.</li>
                        <li><strong>VERSATILE CARGO RACKS</strong> - The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction
                            designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment. They accommodate a variety of
                            standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological
                            samples.</li>

                        <li><strong>PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA</strong> - Dragon was designed from the outset to fly humans to
                            space. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is making upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew
                            carrying capability.</li>
                        <li><strong>CREW UPGRADES</strong> - Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reliable crew
                            transport vehicle, with seating for seven, life-support systems, controls with manual
                            capability, and a powered launch escape system.</li>
                        <li><strong>FIRST LAUNCH</strong> - Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. Dragon’s first manned
                            test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.</li>
