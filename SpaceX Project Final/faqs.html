        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Could SpaceX send a Dragon to the Moon?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">The Dragon could easily be sent to lunar orbit, but it cannot land due to its limited propellant capacity. The Falcon Heavy could send a Dragon 2 capsule to the Moon, but it would lack the necessary velocity change (∆V) required for landing, as Dragon 2 carries only a small amount of propellant. Landing would require a much larger ∆V (~1870 m/s), which Dragon 2 cannot achieve with its current design.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">What is Red Dragon?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">Red Dragon was a proposed mission to send a modified Dragon capsule atop a Falcon Heavy to the Martian surface. It would have been an unmanned scientific lander, capable of carrying additional cargo to Mars. However, the project has not been funded or officially announced by SpaceX, and its design is not currently managed by them.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Will the Dragon be used for a manned mission to Mars?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">No, Dragon is not designed for long-duration human missions to Mars. The spacecraft is too cramped, and significant improvements would be required in its life support systems to sustain astronauts for the long journey. Dragon 2 can support seven astronauts for only "several days," as stated by Elon Musk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Why does the Dragon "berth" to the ISS instead of docking?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">Dragon cannot dock because it uses a Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) instead of the NASA Docking System (NDS). The CBM is larger (50 inches) than the NDS (31.5 inches), but berthing requires astronauts to manually maneuver the capsule into place using Canadarm, and then bolt the ports together. Docking is faster and autonomous, whereas berthing is a more labor-intensive process.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Can Dragon 1 be used to evacuate the International Space Station?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">Dragon 1 is not suitable as an emergency evacuation vehicle for the ISS. It cannot dock and instead "berths" to the station, which is a slow and manual process. Additionally, Dragon is only present at the station for a short period (a month every 6 months), lacks seats, and is typically filled with cargo. The ISS already has Soyuz spacecraft on standby for evacuation if necessary.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Can Dragon or Dragon 2 reboost the International Space Station?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">Dragon is not designed to reboost the ISS. The spacecraft does not carry enough fuel, and the SuperDraco engines are too powerful. The docking ports are not designed to handle the forces of reboosting, and Dragon lacks the necessary connections for station guidance and control. Current reboosting methods are more efficient and do not require modifications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">How much Delta-V does the Dragon 2 have?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">Dragon 2 carries about 420 m/s of Delta-V. This is based on its propellant mass of 1588 kg and the specific impulse of its SuperDraco engines (235 s), which allows it to perform orbital maneuvers and landing sequences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">What would happen if one of Dragon 2's SuperDraco thrusters failed during landing?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">Dragon 2 is designed to lose up to two of its SuperDraco thrusters without issue. If a failure occurs, the spacecraft will deploy parachutes and splash down in the Atlantic Ocean. The SuperDracos are required for active control during descent, but the parachutes ensure a safe landing even with a thruster failure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Will SuperDraco replace Draco?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">No, SuperDraco engines are designed for different purposes. Draco engines are used for in-orbit maneuvers, fine guidance, and deorbiting with a thrust of 400 N, while SuperDraco engines produce 73,000 N of thrust and are used for landing and abort scenarios. They are far more powerful and not suitable for the same tasks as Draco engines.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">What is PICA-X? Does PICA-X ablate?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">PICA-X (Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator) is a heatshield material developed by SpaceX for Dragon. It is designed to withstand high-speed reentries from space, and it ablates (evaporates) to protect the spacecraft from extreme heat. SpaceX improved on NASA’s original PICA design to create a version that is cheaper to manufacture, less prone to ablation, and more reusable. Dragon 2 uses PICA-X Version 3, which ablates even less.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Could Dragon 2 service the Hubble Space Telescope?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">While Dragon 2 could technically service the Hubble Space Telescope, it would not be cost-effective. Modifications such as adding an airlock would be needed, but it would likely be cheaper to build and launch a new telescope rather than retrofit Dragon for the task.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">Why does Dragon's trunk stay attached during an abort scenario?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">During an abort scenario, the trunk helps stabilize the Dragon capsule and prevents it from flipping over due to aerodynamic forces. The trunk’s large surface area and fins help maintain proper orientation until the capsule separates from the trunk, ensuring a controlled descent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="faq-question">How does a Dragon reenter the atmosphere and splashdown?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer">Dragon’s reentry involves three main phases: deorbit, reentry, and landing. In the deorbit phase, Dragon uses its Draco thrusters to slow down and ensure the proper angle for reentry. In the reentry phase, the trunk is jettisoned, and Dragon aligns its heatshield to protect itself from the intense heat. Finally, in the landing phase, drogue chutes slow the capsule, followed by main parachutes, ensuring a safe splashdown in the ocean.</p>
