                <h3>What Web Accessibility Means to Me</h3>
                <p>To me, web accessibility means making websites work for everyone, no matter what kind of physical limitations or disabilities they might have. It's about more than just design; it's making sure that all kinds of users, like those using screen readers or needing bigger text, can still get what they need from a site. This includes stuff like adding captions for videos or making buttons easier to find. It's all about opening up the web to everyone.</p>

                <h3>Why Accessible Websites Matter</h3>
                <p>Accessible websites are important because they give everyone, including those with disabilities, a fair chance to use the internet just like anybody else. Making sites accessible is also required by law in some places, but beyond that, it just makes sense to build something that anyone can use. For example, adding captions to videos doesn't just help those with hearing issues; it also makes a difference for people who are in a loud environment. In the end, accessibility makes the internet better for all of us.</p>
